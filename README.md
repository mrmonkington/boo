Boo
=============

A matrix of buttons useful for triggering events in OSC aware apps,
specifically in this case CasparCG.

Written in Python + GTK3 + Liblo.

## Installation

Distribution shipped `liblo` is fine, so this should be all you need to do:

```
apt-get install liblo
```

## Use

```
./launchpad.py -v --config=config
```

Push the buttons.

## TODO

 - Midi in/out in order to communicate with control surfaces, etc
